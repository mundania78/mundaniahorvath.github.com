								<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
								<p>After agreeing on a rough design of the navigation, I built a prototype in Sketch and pulled it into InVision. The prototype would be used to test different scenarios and tasks with users. This first round was to compare the current navigation to the new design and identify pain points in their first experience.</p>

										<h2>Statements from Usability Test</h2>
									</div>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h3>Positives for Prototype</h3>
									<p class="sm-text">I like the design on the right because it has a white background which is softer on the eyes rather than the black which to me is harsher. I like that the orange lines offer a pop of color while not being overwhelming. I like that the headlines are in larger font.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I like that the PNC logo is located at the very top right corner where I expect it to be. I also like the drop-down menu to be light colored as opposed to the dark gray of the other version. I also found that it was easier to navigate to the Personal and Business because they were much more prominent.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I could already see the categories, therefore there were less options to look at when I open the menu. The left just felt like another click.</p>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h3>Negatives for Prototype</h3>
									<p class="sm-text">The second set of tabs underneath the main tabs on the right seem to be kind of confusing at first. Once I was familiar with, there was not a problem.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">However, a newbie to the website may be confused at first as I was. The one on the left was just more user friendly and the tabs are clearly labeled.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I sometimes have issues with huge drop downs. They can be seen as too long or hard to read.</p>

							<p>A handful of participants were asks to do very specific tasks using our current website and the prototype. At one point, the prototype did give one user some difficulties which might have influenced her decisions. Also, some thought a couple categories were too short and not clear enough. The Usability Test revealed that 75% of the participants found the new layout easier to scan for products and find information faster. Participants were able to successfully complete most of the tasks.</p>

							<h2>Usability-related Outcomes:</h2> 
								<p>We did 2 more usability tests (one in September ’18, one in April ’19). In each test, we got feedback from 75 different people (non-customers) so that we could compare and contrast the usability of the previous menu design with the latest menu design. The new menu design was found to be significantly better than the previous design because:</p>
							
								<ul>
									<li class="goals">1. Most parts of the site required between 20-30% less clicks to find, which means site visitors (on average) should have a more efficient experience on our site.</li><br>
									
									<li class="goals">2. Finding security-related information, as well as finding what to do if you lose your debit card, took 26-49% less time than before. By finding information more quickly, this means customers may have a more ideal experience on our site, and it also means they have a higher chance of “self-serving” (i.e., they don’t have to call customer service for an answer).</li>
