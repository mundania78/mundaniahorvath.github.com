							<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>PNC.com has various types of information including product details, online applications for those products, customer service-related information, as well as thought leadership and educational content. To help make this information easier to find, regardless of someone’s familiarity with PNC’s website, the PNC.com team worked on redesigning the main menu navigation. In addition to improving the information architecture, the redesign also looked toimprove the visual and interaction design of the menu so it would meet the latest best practices.</p>

							<h2>The Challenge</h2>
								<p>Due to the volume of content on PNC.com, the navigation started to become overwhelming to our visitors. At its core, this was a design challenge to address the need to
								optimize the information architecture which drove the need to reimagine the visual and interaction design of the navigation
								to support a more user friendly and accessible presentation.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
								<p>I led the design for PNC.com's navigation redesign and collaborated with two other managers. We worked closely throughout the project, applying feedback from each other along they way, but I was specifically responsible for:</p>	
								<ol class="role">
									<li>Prototype for Usability Testing</li>
									<li>Wireframes</li>
									<li>User Flows </li>
									<li>User Research</li>
									<li>Visual design</li>
									<li>Writing requirements for Developers</li>
								</ol>

								<h2>Defining Taxonomy</h2>
								<p>The first step and a key goal was to define a new taxonomy that our audience would understand. We began this process by writing out each of the main products on our white boards and then broke those down. Behind the scenes there were small tests being done to see if our audience preferred one term over another such as “borrow” versus “lend.” We also did card sorting sessions to help evaluate information architecture.</p>

								<p>We wanted to make sure the navigation would be clearly labeled and use familiar terms throughout so that users would feel more comfortable navigating through the website.</p>

							<h2>Redesigning the Navigation</h2>
								<p>While the categories were being perfected in between managers and producers, I set to work on the design of the new navigation. The main thing to note is the navigation needs to support four types of categorization.</p>

							<h2>Four Main Areas of PNC.com</h2>
								<ul>
									<li class="goals">1. Personal</li>
									<li class="goals">2. Small Business</li>
									<li class="goals">3. Corporate & Institutional </li>
									<li class="goals">4. About Us</li>
								</ul>

								<p>This navigation was designed with the intent of driving more customers to our main products before exploring categories. One of the first things that I did was move our logo to the very top. I felt as though it was shoved under the first tier. Customers that arrive at the homepage automatically land on Personal. They must first click on a top tier section to find what they are searching for.</p>

								<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
								<p>After agreeing on a rough design of the navigation, I built a prototype in Sketch and pulled it into InVision. The prototype would be used to test different scenarios and tasks with users. This first round was to compare the current navigation to the new design and identify pain points in their first experience.</p>

								<h2>Statements from Usability Test</h2>
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h3>Positives for Prototype</h3>
									<p class="sm-text">I like the design on the right because it has a white background which is softer on the eyes rather than the black which to me is harsher. I like that the orange lines offer a pop of color while not being overwhelming. I like that the headlines are in larger font.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I like that the PNC logo is located at the very top right corner where I expect it to be. I also like the drop-down menu to be light colored as opposed to the dark gray of the other version. I also found that it was easier to navigate to the Personal and Business because they were much more prominent.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I could already see the categories, therefore there were less options to look at when I open the menu. The left just felt like another click.</p>
							</div><!-- /.col -->

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h3>Negatives for Prototype</h3>
									<p class="sm-text">The second set of tabs underneath the main tabs on the right seem to be kind of confusing at first. Once I was familiar with, there was not a problem.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">However, a newbie to the website may be confused at first as I was. The one on the left was just more user friendly and the tabs are clearly labeled.</p>

									<p class="sm-text">I sometimes have issues with huge drop downs. They can be seen as too long or hard to read.</p>

							<p>A handful of participants were asks to do very specific tasks using our current website and the prototype. At one point, the prototype did give one user some difficulties which might have influenced her decisions. Also, some thought a couple categories were too short and not clear enough. The Usability Test revealed that 75% of the participants found the new layout easier to scan for products and find information faster. Participants were able to successfully complete most of the tasks.</p>

							<h2>Usability-related Outcomes:</h2> 
							<p>We did 2 more usability tests (one in Fall ’19, one in April ’19). In each test, we got feedback from 75 different people (non-customers) so that we could compare and contrast the usability of the previous menu design with the latest menu design. The new menu design was found to be significantly better than the previous design because:</p>
							
								<ul>
									<li>1. Most parts of the site required between 20-30% less clicks to find, which means site visitors (on average) should have a more efficient experience on our site.</li>
									
									<li>2. Finding security-related information, as well as finding what to do if you lose your debit card, took 26-49% less time than before. By finding information more quickly, this means customers may have a more ideal experience on our site, and it also means they have a higher chance of “self-serving” (i.e., they don’t have to call customer service for an answer).</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Iteration</h2>
									<p>After the key takeaways from the Usability Test, we reworked a couple of the categories for the navigation. The example here focuses on the desktop experience because it is responsible for the majority of our visitors. Also, due to accessibility issues with our color orange, I had to rethink the links and colors. </p>

							<h2>Final Product & Results</h2>
								<p>Due to the main developer’s concern in releasing our new navigation all at once, we are releasing it in three phases. The first phase is keeping current categories but introducing the new look. The second phase will update each of the categories and fix any errors within the visuals. The third phase will complete the project and update the tablet and mobile experience. Just from the new layout, the site has seen a traffic increase on navigation browsing and clicks. We have also had positive reaction from our business partners which is important as well.</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<p>I am pleased with how the navigation turned out and how I was able to put a large amount of information into a fairly simple layout. 

								One thing I would do differently is test in the earlier stages of the prototype phase. Our testing team tried to encourage us to do this but I thought this might be a bad idea since the new website was going to be a drastically different from the previous one. So did other team members. Now looking back, I think going in sooner with wireframes might have been a great idea in order to receive feedback a lot sooner.</p>
