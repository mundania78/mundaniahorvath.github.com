Conceptualization
I started creating the information architecture and low-fi concepts for primary use cases. After having a go-ahead from the Product Manager, developers, and Stakeholders on the mockups, we began to conduct usability tests with the low-fidelity mockups. Once we had confidence in the design, we began digitalizing designs.

Navigation should be clearly labeled and signposted so that users understand where they are and where they can go to.

By using appropriate and familiar copy for your navigation elements throughout your product’s design, your users will feel more comfortable navigating your website. When consistency is maintained and clarity promoted, it makes the navigation easier to comprehend.

For example, a navigation bar will usually link to designated landing pages which are labelled with the right text that makes the most sense.

Align navigation design with user goals
Ideally, good navigation will cater to a primary group of people who have primary goals. User personas are a way of capturing these primary groups.

In a way, when you align your navigation with your user goals, you’re dabbling in reverse engineering. By identifying the needs of your group, you’ll be able to create a navigation that helps them.

How do you identify the needs of your users? You ask questions. Questions, like the ones James Kalbach outlines in Designing Web Navigation:

How can I quickly find specific information or product I want?
How do I know that information is up-to-date?
Is the site’s content trustworthy
How can I contact the site owner?
How can I send information I find to people I know?
